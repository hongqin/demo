#The full tutorial contains a little more information (e.g., a note on how to install R).

# R Basics

## Vectors

#Vectors are a core data structure in R, and are created with `c()`. Elements in a vector must be of the same type.

	numbers = c(23, 13, 5, 7, 31)
	names = c("edwin", "alice", "bob")
		
#Elements are indexed starting at 1, and are accessed with `[]` notation.

	numbers[1] # 23
	names[1] # edwin

## Data frames

#[Data frames](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/data-frame) are like matrices, but with named columns of different types (similar to [database tables](http://code.google.com/p/sqldf/)).

    books = data.frame(
        title = c("harry potter", "war and peace", "lord of the rings"),
        author = c("rowling", "tolstoy", "tolkien"),
        num_pages = c("350", "875", "500")
    )
	
#You can access columns of a data frame with `$`.

	books$title # c("harry potter", "war and peace", "lord of the rings")
	books$author[1] # "rowling"
	
#You can also create new columns with `$`.

	books$num_bought_today = c(10, 5, 8)
	books$num_bought_yesterday = c(18, 13, 20)
	
	books$total_num_bought = books$num_bought_today + books$num_bought_yesterday
	
## read.table

#Suppose you want to import a TSV file into R as a data frame.

### tsv file without header

#For example, consider the [`data/students.tsv`](https://github.com/echen/r-tutorial/blob/master/data/students.tsv) file (with columns describing each student's age, test score, and name).
    
#We can import this file into R using [`read.table()`](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/read.table.html)

    students = read.table(
        "data/students.tsv", 
        header = F, 
        sep = "\t", 
        col.names = c("age", "score", "name")
    )
    
#where

#* `header = F` means that the file does not contain a header (`F` is shorthand for `FALSE`)
#* `sep = "\t"` means that the file is tab-delimited
#* `col.names = c("age", "score", "name")` tells R the column names

#We can now access the different columns in the data frame with `students$age`, `students$score`, and `students$name`.

### csv file with header

#For an example of a file in a different format, look at the [`data/studentsWithHeader.tsv`](https://github.com/echen/r-tutorial/blob/master/data/studentsWithHeader.tsv) file.
    
#Here we have the same data, but now the file is comma-delimited and contains a header. We can import this file with

    students = read.table("data/students.tsv", header = T, sep = ",")
    
#By setting `header = T`, we tell R that the first line of the file contains column names, so we can immediately access `students$age` and so on. (Note: there is also a `read.csv` function that uses `sep = ","` by default.)

## help

#There are many more options that `read.table` can take. For a full list of these, just type `help(read.table)` (or equivalently, `?read.table`) at the prompt to access documentation.

    help(read.table)
    ?read.table

#This works for other functions as well.

# ggplot2

#With these R basics in place, let's dive into the ggplot2 package.

## Installation

#One of R's greatest strengths is its excellent set of [packages](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html). To install a package, you can use the `install.packages()` function.

   # install.packages("ggplot2")
    
#To load a package into your current R session, use `library()`.

    library(ggplot2)
    
## Scatterplots with qplot()

#Let's look at how to create a scatterplot in ggplot2. We'll use the `iris` data frame that's automatically loaded into R.

#What does the data frame contain? We can use the `head` function to look at the first few rows.

    head(iris) # by default, head displays the first 6 rows
    head(iris, n = 10) # we can also explicitly set the number of rows to display
               
#(The data frame actually contains three types of species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.)
               
#Let's plot `Sepal.Length` against `Petal.Length` using ggplot2's `qplot()` function.

    qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data = iris)
    # Plot Sepal.Length vs. Petal.Length, using data from the `iris` data frame.
    
#To see where each species is located in this graph, we can color each point by adding a `color = Species` argument.

    qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data = iris, color = Species) # dude!
    
#Similarly, we can let the size of each point denote sepal width, by adding a `size = Sepal.Width` argument.

    qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data = iris, color = Species, size = Petal.Width)
    # We see that Iris setosa flowers have the narrowest petals.
    
    qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data = iris, color = Species, size = Petal.Width, alpha = I(0.7))
    # By setting the alpha of each point to 0.7, we reduce the effects of overplotting.

#Finally, let's fix the axis labels and add a title to the plot.

    qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data = iris, color = Species,
        xlab = "Sepal Length", ylab = "Petal Length", 
        main = "Sepal vs. Petal Length in Fisher's Iris data")
        
## Other common geoms

#In the scatterplot examples above, we implicitly used a *point* **geom**, the default when you supply two arguments to `qplot()`.

    # These two invocations are equivalent.
    qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data = iris, geom = "point")
    qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data = iris)
    
#But we can easily use other types of geoms to create other kinds of plots.

### Barcharts: geom = "bar"

    movies = data.frame(
        director = c("spielberg", "spielberg", "spielberg", "jackson", "jackson"),
        movie = c("jaws", "avatar", "schindler's list", "lotr", "king kong"),
        minutes = c(124, 163, 195, 600, 187)
    )
    
    # Plot the number of movies each director has.
    qplot(director, data = movies, geom = "bar", ylab = "# movies")
    #qplot(director, data = movies, geom = "point", ylab = "# movies") #Error 
    
    qplot(director, movie, data = movies, geom = "point")
    qplot(director, minutes, data = movies, geom = "point")
    # By default, the height of each bar is simply a count.
    
    # But we can also supply a different weight.
    # Here the height of each bar is the total running time of the director's movies.
    qplot(director, weight = minutes, data = movies, geom = "bar", ylab = "total length (min.)")
    
    
### Line charts: geom = "line"
        
    qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data = iris, geom = "line", color = Species) 
    # Using a line geom doesn't really make sense here, but hey.
    
    # `Orange` is another built-in data frame that describes the growth of orange trees.
    qplot(age, circumference, data = Orange, geom = "line",
        colour = Tree,
        main = "How does orange tree circumference vary with age?")
        
    # We can also plot both points and lines.
    qplot(age, circumference, data = Orange, geom = c("point", "line"), colour = Tree)
    
# Next Steps

#In this post, I skipped over a lot of aspects of R and ggplot2.

#For example,

#* There are many geoms (and other functionalities) in ggplot2 that I didn't cover, e.g., [boxplots](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/geom_boxplot.html) and [histograms](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/geom_histogram.html).
#* I didn't talk about ggplot2's layering system, or the [grammar of graphics](http://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448) it's based on.

#So I'll end with some additional resources on R and ggplot2.

#* I don't use it myself, but [RStudio](http://rstudio.org/) is a popular IDE for R.
#* The [official ggplot2 documentation](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/) is great and has lots of examples. There's also an excellent [book](http://www.amazon.com/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/0387981403).
#* [plyr](http://plyr.had.co.nz/) is another fantastic R package that's also by Hadley Wickham (the author of ggplot2).
#* The [official R introduction](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html) is okay, but definitely not great. I haven't found any R tutorials I really like, but I've heard good things about [The Art of R Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Programming-Statistical-Software-Design/dp/1593273843).
